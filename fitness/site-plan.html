			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The primary purpose of the FITNESS-LOG web application is to provide users with a clean, responsive interface to log and track their daily workouts and consistently monitor their progress toward long-term fitness goals. It serves as a central, digital notebook that promotes better consistency and measurable results for strength and cardio training.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience is beginner to intermediate fitness enthusiasts and dedicated hobbyists (ages 18-45) who engage in strength training or running/cardio. They are looking for a simple, visual tool to organize their routine, see personalized metrics, and quickly enter workout data without the complexity of a full-featured commercial app.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>JavaScript will be used for four main dynamic elements:
                <ol>
                    <li>DOM Interaction: Capturing user input from the workout logging form and dynamically inserting the new workout session as a table row or list item onto the history page.</li>
                    <li>Data Management (Objects & Arrays): Storing all past workouts as an Array of Objects. Data structures will be organized using ES Modules.</li>
                    <li>Conditional Branching: Validating user input in the form (e.g., checking if the weight field is a positive number) and displaying an error message if the input is invalid.</li>
                    <li>Array Methods: Using array methods like `reduce()` or `filter()` to calculate and display summary statistics (e.g., total weight lifted, average distance run) on the Home page dashboard.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page (index.html)</h3>
			<p>
                Content: A welcoming heading and a brief value statement. The primary content is a Summary Dashboard area.
                <br>
                Data: Dynamic statistics displayed using JS, including: "Total Workouts Logged," "Personal Bests" (e.g., heaviest lift or longest run), and a visual chart/graph of workout frequency over the last month.
                <br>
                Images/Icons: One main motivational fitness image, and small icons next to each metric (e.g., a barbell, a running shoe, a calendar).
            </p>
			<h3>Log Workout / History (log-workout.html)</h3>
			<p>
                Content: A clearly labeled Workout Logging Form with fields for: Date, Exercise Name, Type (Strength/Cardio), Metric (Weight/Distance), and Value. Below the form will be a dynamically generated "Workout History" table/list showing all previous entries (Date, Exercise, Result).
                <br>
                Data: The core JavaScript Array of Objects containing all past workout entries will be displayed here.
                <br>
                Images/Icons: Minimal icons for form buttons (e.g., a disk icon for 'Save').
            </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
                The Home page wireframe will show a main header, navigation, and a central section divided into three primary dashboard panels: A call-to-action to log a workout, key metric numbers, and a progress chart.
            </p>
            <img src="images/home-wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

            <h3>Log Workout / History Wireframe</h3>
            <p>
                The Log Workout page wireframe will show the header and navigation, a dedicated form filling the top half of the screen, and a list/table section displaying the history of past workouts below it.
            </p>
             <img src="images/log-wireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
